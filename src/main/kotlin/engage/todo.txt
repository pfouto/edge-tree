Client Proxy and manager should be the same

Create new storage with logic from engage-cassandra
    - vc and check when ops can be executed

Make tree dynamic (use same manager as arboreal)

Root sends VC periodically down the tree -> received from storage
    - Use mf timer for this?

No need for any client-side info (we will not do migrations)
